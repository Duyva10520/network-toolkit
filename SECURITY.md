| < 1.0   | ❌ No              |

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Built-in Security
- **No External Dependencies**: 100% Python standard library reduces attack surface
- **Local Execution Only**: No data sent to external servers
- **Localhost Scanning**: Port scans limited to localhost by default
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated
- **Safe File Operations**: Secure file handling with proper encoding

### Network Security
- **Limited Scope**: Network scans are restricted to prevent abuse
- **Timeout Protection**: All network operations have timeouts
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network errors
- **No Credential Storage**: Tool doesn't store or transmit credentials

## 🔍 Security Considerations

### When Using Network Toolkit

#### ✅ Safe Practices
- Run on trusted networks only
- Use for legitimate network testing
- Keep logs secure and private
- Regular updates to latest version
- Review exported data before sharing

#### ⚠️ Potential Risks
- **Network Scanning**: May trigger security alerts
- **Log Files**: Contain network information
- **HTML Reports**: May contain sensitive data
- **Port Scanning**: Could be flagged by security tools

#### 🚫 Prohibited Uses
- Scanning networks without permission
- Penetration testing without authorization
- Malicious network reconnaissance
- Violating terms of service
- Illegal activities

## 🛠️ Security Best Practices

### For Users
```bash
# Run with minimal privileges
python network_toolkit.py

# Secure log files
chmod 600 network_toolkit_logs_*.json

# Clean up sensitive data
rm network_toolkit_logs_*.json
rm network_toolkit_report_*.html
```

### For Developers
- Input sanitization for all user inputs
- Proper error handling without information leakage
- Secure file operations
- Network timeout enforcement
- Logging security considerations
